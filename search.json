They analyze key economic indicators like GDP, inflation, employment, and investment, aiming to capture interdependencies among aggregate economic variables.\nMultisector CGE models, on the other hand, break down the economy into specific sectors (e.g., agriculture, industry, services) to analyze the effects of policy changes or shocks on each sector individually. This version is particularly useful in trade policy, environmental regulation, or energy policy, as it highlights how impacts may vary across sectors, thereby allowing for targeted policy insights."

Check that the desired classification exists in the mdl files\nmodel_folder: the folder where to find the mdl files (either training or threeme usually)\nproject_name: name to give your project, must be alphanumeric and underscore characters only. No accents. lowercase only\nscenario_baseline : Name of the baseline scenario. By default it is « baseline-steady ». It may be modified if the baseline needs to integrate some user-specified trajectories of exogenous variables. All scenarii files are located in configuration/scenarii_calib\nscenario: Name of scenario(s) to run. Make sure a file 2_calib_shock_NAMEOFSCENARIO exists in the configuration/scenarii_calib folders. Scenario naes must be alphanumeric and underscores in lowercase only. See this page for more info on scenario calibration. The scenario parameter can be a named vector in order to give more information about the scenario that can be reused in results outputs, e.g.:\n\n\n  scenario = c(\"ct1\", \"expg1\") |&gt; \n  set_names(c(\"Increase of carbon tax  \",\"Increase in government spending of 1% of GDP\"))\n\n\nbaseyear: Input the base year used for the calibration data\nlastyear: Last year of the simulations\nshockyear: year of the shock. This is an optional parameter that can be called upon when calibrating shocks\nmax_lags: maximum lags used in the model, to know how far back the database must go in order for the solver to evaluate all model equations.\nfirstyear: By default this is baseyear - max_lags (rarely needs to be modified)\nautomated_shocks: Set to TRUE if you want to use automated shocks, that will read one unique shock scenario file that can run different calibrations according to the scenario name (needs further documentation)\nvariables_to_keep: Vector of variables to keep in the output. Input an empty vector (c()) in order to keep all variables.\n\nModel file lists\nThe second sections contains mdl file lists. In three parts, there is: - list_files : basic files (maily for ThreeME, does not need to be modified) - calib_files: mdl files that contain data calibration equations - model_files: mdl files that contain the models equations.\nmdl files are usually organised by blocs. For ThreeME some are required to function but other can be activated or switched out with alternate versions to test out different model structures. Usually, an mdl file that starts with Exception is a model block that will be specific to a shock or scenario that requires additional equations to function. ENDOFLINE.mdl is an empty mdl that must be inserted last in the vector.\n\nlists_files &lt;- c(\n  \"lists.mdl\" \n)\n\n## Calibration files\ncalib_files &lt;- c(lists_files,\n                 \"03.1-calib.mdl\",     # Close economy\n                 \"03.2-calib.mdl\",     # Open economy\n                 \n                 \"ENDOFLINE.mdl\"       # ALL VERSIONS: empty file\n                 \n)\n\n# Model files \nmodel_files = c(lists_files,\n                \n                \"03.1-eq.mdl\",         # Close economy \n                \"03.2-eq.mdl\",         # Close economy\n                \n                \"ENDOFLINE.mdl\"        # ALL VERSIONS: empty file\n                \n)\n\nGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG\n\nconfiguration/config_training.R : It is the file where the main options to configure the simulation are loacted.\n\n\n# file.edit(\"configuration/config_training.R\")\nsource(\"configuration/config_training.R\")"
