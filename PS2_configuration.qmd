## Session objectives

<br>

- Learn how to configure a simulation
- Explore .mdl files
- Add graphs on your quarto and such with built-in functions 


##



Session 2 Walrasian model and running a pre-configured shock scenario

back to practice. Open the repository
locate the model files for the walrasian model : calib and equations
comment on the calib file : what does it all mean 
create a copy of the config input file
create a copy of the main file, call it main_session2
prepare the config input file and config output to present the macro result template 
prepare the main file to run the simulations as specified 

- run the model 
- create a new shock file to run a different size of shock
