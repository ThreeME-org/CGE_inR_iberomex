# What is a CGE model?

## Definition {.scrollable}

-   **Computable:** numerical simulation

-   **General:** take into account the interactions between markets.

    -   Supply and demand influence each other

-   **Equilibrium:** Supply is equal to demand on all markets (good, production factors)

-   Structure of a CGE model (see next Figure):

    -   Demand (Consumption, investment) defines the supply (production)
    -   Supply defines in return the demand through the incomes generated by the production factors

## CGE model {.scrollable}

![](pictures/schema.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## What does "general equilibrium" mean? {.scrollable}

-   General Equilibrium relates to a state where supply is equal to demand in all markets

-   2 main approaches to insure this state:

    -   **Walrasian** models
        -   The equilibrium force is the price system

        -   Perfect price flexibility insure the instantaneous equilibrium between supply and demand

        -   When the supply of a commodity goes down, its price tends to go up, thereby stimulating additional supply and depressing demand, until supply and demand are equal again.

        -   Static model
    -   **Neo-Keynesian** models
        -   Demand determines supply
        -   Price and quantities are rigid and adjust slowly
        -   Disequilibrium between notional (optimal) supply and the actual supply in the short run
        -   Dynamic model: transition to the long run

## A neo-keynesian CGE model {.scrollable}

-   **Slow adjustment** of price and quantity

    -   Adjustment costs
    -   Empirically firms adjust their production to the demand rather than their price

-   Leads to situation of **disequilibrium** between the desired supply and demand

-   **Prices** are defined as a mark-up over the firm's production costs

    -   Production costs integrate intermediary consumption (material and energy), labor and capital costs

-   Wages are determined by a **Wage Setting (WS) curve**

    -   Phillips curve: wages increase with inflation and decrease with unemployment
    -   Wages do not adjust instantaneously the supply and demand for labor:
        -   Permanent underemployment equilibrium possible
        -   Theory of the NAIRU (Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) or Equilibrium rate of unemployment

-   The **interest rate** does not equilibrate instantaneously saving and investment:

    -   It is defined by the Central Bank
    -   "Taylor" reaction function: increases with inflation, decreases with unemployment

# Main usage of CGE models

## Macroeconomic versus multisector CGE models {.scrollable}

CGE models are widely used in economic policy analysis. Two type of analyses:

-   **Macroeconomic CGE models** focus on understanding how an entire economy responds to shocks or policy changes

    -   e.g. fiscal, monetary, trade, innovation policies
    -   they aim to capture interdependencies between aggregate economic variables and key economic indicators
        -   e.g. GDP, inflation, employment, and investment

-   **Multisector CGE models** break down the economy into several sectors to analyze the effects of policy changes or shocks on each sector individually

    -   e.g. energy, agriculture, industry, services
    -   main applications: trade policy, environmental regulation, energy policy, large-scale events like natural disasters
    -   highlight how impacts may vary across sectors
    -   allow for simulating sector specific policy

## Examples of applications of our R package {.scrollable}

### Small size models

-   Small CGE model

-   Today's course

### Large size models

-   Econometric models (Opale and Mesange)

    -   Quarterly models for short term forcast

-   Multi-sector models

    -   e.g. open source ThreeME model

    -   www.threeme.org

## Overview of ThreeME {.scrollable}

-   **M**ulti-sector **M**acroeconomic **M**odel for the **E**valuation of **E**nvironmental and **E**nergy policy.

    -   Open source model
    
    -   Download and documentation: https://www.threeme.org/
    
    -   ThreeME is **neo-Keynesian general equilibrium** model.

    -   Designed to study scenario involving transfers of activities from one sector to another

## Overview of ThreeME: types of simulations of the economic and environmental impacts {.scrollable}

-   **Energy transition policies**

    -   Fiscal policies:
        -   Carbon tax with or without redistribution of the tax revenue
        -   Phasing out subsidies on (fossil fuel) energy
        -   Bonus-malus for cars: subsidies on green cars financed by a tax on other cars
    -   Change in the electricity production mix
        -   Ex: more RES in the mix
    -   Impact of green investment
        -   In buildings, public transport, etc.
        -   Impact of applying a new standard for buildings, or appliances

-   **External shock**

    -   Increase in international oil/gas price

# Micro-economic foundations of CGE models

## Behavior equations versus identities {.scrollable}

-   CGE models have behavioral and identity equations
-   **Behavioral equations** derive from microeconomic theory and economic rationality
    -   Economic behavior of producers, consumers, and other agents in the model
-   **Identity equations** define a variable according to a definition as a mathematical function (sum, product, etc.) of other variables
    -   Accountancy variables (e.g. GDP, price index), unemployment rate, etc.

## Behavior equations {.scrollable}

### **Prices**

-   We assume oligopolistic competition *à la* Cournot where each producer defines its price in order to maximize its profit considering the price of the other producers as given:

-   The **maximisation program** is:

$$max_y Π(y) = p(y).y - c(y)$$

where $y$ is the production or demand adressed to the compagny, $\pi(y)$ is the profit of the compagny, $p(y)$ its price and $c(y)$ the production cost. We assume $p′(y)$ \< 0, $c′(y)$ \> 0 and $c′′(y)$ \> 0

-   The result of the **program maximization defines the optimum price** that is equal to a markup over the production costs:

$$p(y)= [1+ m^{up}].c'(y)$$

where the markup is: \begin{equation} m^{up}= 1/(\epsilon -1) \end{equation} and $\epsilon$ the (absolute) price elasticity of demand

-   In perfect competition, markup is zero: \begin{equation} m^{up} = 0 \end{equation} so that the optimal price is equal to the marginal cost of production: \begin{equation} p(y)= c'(y) \end{equation}

-   Given that production costs equal total factor payments, the **optimal price is therefore equal to the cost of capital and labor**:

$$p(y).y= w.L+ p(\delta+r).K$$

## Behavior equations {.scrollable}

### **Households consumption**

-   We assume that households supply labor and own the capital, for which they get their income ($w.L + p.r.K$) .

-   We assume that households wish to use a fixed share of their total income for consumption

$$CH = \left( 1 - \sigma \right) . \frac{\left( w . L + p . r . K \right)}{p}$$

-   Can be derive from alternative theoretical model of consumption.

-   For instance: let us assume that the consumer maximize its (CES) utility by allocating the income of a given period over several periods.

The **maximization program** is:

$$max_{c_i} U(c_1, c_2, ... c_n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\phi_i.c_i^{\frac{\rho-1}{\rho}})^{\frac{\rho}{\rho-1}}$$ $$\ s.t \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i.c_i = R$$ where $\rho$ is the elasticity of substitution, $c_i$ the consumption of good in period $i$ and $R$ total income.

The resolution of this program gives the relationship between households consumption and total income :

$$p_i.c_i= (\Phi_i)^{\rho}.(\frac{p_i}{P})^{1-\rho}.R$$ where $(\Phi_i)^{\rho}.(\frac{p_i}{P})^{1-\rho}$ is the consumption share.

Considering only two periods: $i=1$ (present) and $i=2$ (future) and assuming a CES function with $\rho=1$, we find that **consumption is a constant share of income**:

$$p_1.c_1 = \phi_1.R$$ with $\phi_1$ = (1-$\sigma$) and $\sigma$ the propensity to save.

## Behavior equations {.scrollable}

### **Demand for production factors**

-   The firm determines its demand for labor and capital by maximizing its profit, which is equivalent to **minimizing its production cost taking into account the production function**.

-   Assuming a CES production function, the constrained cost minimization program is:

$$min_{x_i} (\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i.x_i)$$

$$\ s.t. \ Q= Q(x_i) = (\sum_{i=1}^{n} \Phi_i.x_i^{(\frac{\rho-1}{\rho})})^{(\frac{\rho}{\rho-1})}$$ where $\rho$ is the elasticity of substitution between inputs.

-   The resolution of the program derives demand for factors expressed as follows:\
    **Labor demand**:

$$L = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{L}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{L} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{w}{\left( p . PROG^{L} \right)} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)}$$

**Capital demand**:

$$ K = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{K}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{K} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{\left( \delta + r \right)}{PROG^{K}} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)} $$

## Behavior equations {.scrollable}

### **CES function**

The Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function proposed by Arrow et al. (1961) offers flexibility in modeling substitutability between production factors

$$Y = \left(\tilde{\varphi_1} X_1^{\frac{\eta - 1}{\eta}} + \tilde{\varphi}_2 X_2^{\frac{\eta - 1}{\eta}}\right)^{\frac{\eta}{\eta - 1}}$$

where:

-   $Y$ the output,

-   $\tilde\varphi_1$ and $\tilde\varphi_2$ respectively the weights for inputs $X_1$ and $X_2$,

-   $\eta$ the Elasticity of Substitution (ES) taking possibly any value between $]0;+\infty[$

The CES function enables the representation of varying degrees of substitutability:

-   perfect complementarity $\eta = 0$ (Leontief function)
-   perfect substitutability $\eta \rightarrow \infty$
-   Cobb-Douglas function where the ES is unitary $\eta = 1$.

## Identities and defnitions {.scrollable}

### **Production**

$$Y = CH + I + G$$

-   Market equilibrium condition between supply and demand\
-   Accountancy equation that states that everything that is being produced (total supply) is “consumed”, either as household’s consumption, investment or government spending (total demand)

<br>

### **Capital accumulation**

-   Given an initial capital stock (at $t-1$), the change in capital stock defines the capital stock in $t$:

$$\varDelta \left(K\right) = I_{t-1} - \delta . K_{t-1}$$

-   The change in capital stock :
    -   Increases with the investment made in the previous period ($I_{t-1}$)\
    -   Decreases with the depreciation of the capital stock ($\delta.K_{t-1}$)

<br>

### **Cost of capital**

We assume that the cost of capital is defined as the user cost of capital (or real rental price of capital services or the costs of holding capital) :

$$c^{K} = p(\delta + r)$$

where $\delta$ is the depreciation rate of capital, $r$ the interest rate and $p$ the price of the investment.

-   This equation may have several interpretations:
    -   It reflects the opportunity cost of holding capital, that is the cost of not been able to invest an existing financial wealth into another asset
    -   It assumes that capital is financed through bank credit and that the reimbursement of the debt corresponds to the depreciation of capital

# Macroeconomic closure

## Some definitions {.scrollable}

-   [**Endo**]{style="color: brown;"}**genous variable**: defined [**inside**]{style="color: brown;"} the model, as a result of the model simulation
    -   One equation for each endogenous variable
    -   Eg. production, consumption, prices, wages, etc.
-   [**Exo**]{style="color: brown;"}**genous variable**: defined [**outside**]{style="color: brown;"} the model
    -   No equation in the model defining this variable: hypothesis of the model
    -   Eg. population, price of imports (for a one country model)
-   **Parameter**: from a mathematical point of view, an **exogenous variable** that is generally **constant**
    -   Eg. elasticities (substitution, indexation, etc.), depreciation rate, tax rate, etc.
-   **Representative agent**: an average relevant economic agent that follows an optimizing/rational economic behaviour
    -   Households, producers, government
    -   Optimize an objective: e.g. maximization of profit/utility/social welfare, minimization of cost

## Macroeconomic closure {.scrollable}

-   A [**model**]{style="color: brown;"} is a way of explaining endogenous variables as function of exogenous variables.\
-   Making a choice of what is to be determined within the model [**(endogenous variables)**]{style="color: brown;"} and what is to be considered external to the model [**(exogenous variables)**]{style="color: brown;"} is called the [**model closure**]{style="color: brown;"}. 
-   Why does the choice of the model closure matter ?

    -   It may define the direction of causality (which variables determine the others)
    -   It may have important implications on the properties and results of the model

**Simulation experiment:** What is the impact of an increase in public spending (multiplier of public expenditures) on the endogenous variables of the model depending on the choice of the closure ?

We compare the results for two contrasting model closures:

-   [**The Walrasian model**]{style="color: brown;"}
-   [**The Keynesian model**]{style="color: brown;"}

## Walrasian versus Keynesian models {.scrollable}

[**Common features for both models**]{style="color: brown;"}:

-   [**General equilibrium**]{style="color: blue;"}: which means that supply equals demand in all markets.\
-   In both frameworks, the models consist of equations that solve for the endogenous variables, given the exogenous variables and parameters. A change in one or more exogenous variable or parameter will lead to adjustments in the endogenous variables so to solve the system of equations again. These [**solved values of all endogenous variables**]{style="color: blue;"}, constitute the [**outcome of the model**]{style="color: blue;"} .

[**Main difference between both models**]{style="color: brown;"}:

-   The [**choice of endogenous variables**]{style="color: blue;"}. In the Walrasian framework some variables adjust while there are considered fixed in the Keynesian framework and vice-versa.

*Note*: Our definitions of the Walrasian and Keynesian closures may differ from those found in the literature inspired by the seminal work of Sen (1963). Contrary to this literature that consider a **static** case, we propose simulations based on a **dynamic** model including an equation for **capital accumulation** and where investment is endogenous in both the Walrasian and the Keynesian closure.

## The Walrasian model {.scrollable}

The model is based on a set of **7 equations** with **7 endogenous variables**:

-   [Investment]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$I = Y - CH - G$$

-   [Production]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$Y . p = w . L + p . \left( \delta + r \right) . K$$

-   [Households'consumption]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$CH = \left( 1 - \sigma \right) . \frac{\left( w . L + p . r . K \right)}{p}$$

-   [Wage]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$w + L = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{L}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{L} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{w}{\left( p . PROG^{L} \right)} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)}  + w$$

-   [Interest rate]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$r + K = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{K}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{K} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{\left( \delta + r \right)}{PROG^{K}} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)} + r$$

-   [Capital (from accumulation equation)]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$\varDelta \left(K\right) = I_{t-1} - \delta . K_{t-1}$$

-   [Price]{style="color: blue;"}\
    $$p=1$$

-   The price equation defines the price as *numéraire* (equal to 1). The price can therefore be seen as an **exogenous variable**. The model could be written as a set of **6 equations** with **6 endogenous variables**.

## Comments on the Walrasian model closure {.scrollable}

-   **Endogenous variables**: $Y$, $I$, $CH$, $K$, $w$, $r$
-   **Exogenous variables**: $G$, $L$, $p$, $PROG^{L}$, $PROG^{K}$
    -   **Parameters**: $\rho$, $\varphi^{L}$, $\varphi^{K}$, $\delta$, $\sigma$
-   Production is determined by the "price equation" because the price is set to 1 (*numéraire*) and is therefore an exogenous variable.
-   Investment is determined endogenously as the difference between production and (private and public) consumption
-   Labor is exogenous so that the "labor demand equation" does not determine labor but the wage
-   The equation that determines capital is the one of capital accumulation, so the "capital demand equation" derived from profit maximization does not determine capital but the interest rate
-   In the Walrasian framework, savings define investment, wages and interest rate adjust to clear the capital and labor markets

*Note*: we consider a **steady state economy** (with growth rate = 0%)

## The Keynesian model {.scrollable}

The model is based on a set of **6 equations** with **6 endogenous variables**:

-   [Production]{style="color: blue;"}

$$Y = CH + I + G$$

-   [Price]{style="color: blue;"}

$$p . Y = w . L + p . \left( \delta + r \right) . K^{n}$$

-   [Households consumption]{style="color: blue;"}

$$CH = \left( 1 - \sigma \right) . \frac{\left( w . L + p . r . K \right)}{p}$$

-   [Labor]{style="color: blue;"}

$$L = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{L}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{L} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{w}{\left( p . PROG^{L} \right)} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)}$$

-   [Capital (notional level from cost minimization of a CES function )]{style="color: blue;"}

$$K^{n} = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{K}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{K} \right) ^ {\rho} \right) . \left( \frac{\left( \delta + r \right)}{PROG^{K}} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho \right)}$$

-   [Capital (effective level from capital accumulation)]{style="color: blue;"}

$$\varDelta \left(K\right) = I_{t-1} - \delta . K_{t-1}$$

-   [Investment]{style="color: blue;"}

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} I\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} K^{n}_{t-1}\right) + \alpha^{I,Kn} . \operatorname{log} \frac{K^{n}_{t-1}}{K_{t-1}}$$

## Comments on the Keynesian model closure {.scrollable}

-   In the Keynesian closure, the wage and the interest rate are exogenous whereas labor and capital are endogenous
-   To represent the slow adjustment of price and quantities, it is convenient to distinguish between notional and effective level\
-   The notional levels are mentioned with the underscore (superscript) “n” in the model They refer to the level of price, consumption, labor and capital the producer and the consumer would like to reach immediately if there were no adjustment constraint

We consider two versions of the model:

- **Open economy** : The model is found in <span style="color: green;"> `r file.path("src", "model", "training", "03.1-eq_neokeynes_exception_open.mdl")`</span>

There are only small differences between both models, to which we will come back later. But first, let's start by exploring the set of equations in the model considering a **close economy**.

# Neo-Keynesian closure: close economy

## Introduction  {.scrollable}

The close economy model consists of a set of equations regarding:

- Producers    
- Consumers      
- Government and central bank        
- Labor market         
- Adjustments        

## Producers: main equations  {.scrollable}

- **Production**

\begin{equation}
Y = CH + I + G
\end{equation}


- **Notional demand of factors**

\begin{equation}
L^{n} = \left( \frac{Y}{PROG^{L}} \right) . \left( \left( \varphi^{L} \right) ^ {\rho^{KL}} \right) . \left( \frac{\left( \frac{w}{PROG^{L}} \right)}{c^{Y}} \right) ^ {\left( -\rho^{KL} \right)}

## Adjustments: Introduction  {.scrollable}

- Important feature of Neo-Keynesian models: hypothesis of slow adjustments of prices and quantities. Firms do not adjust instantaneously firms but gradually adjust their **effective** price and quantity to the **optimal (notional of desired)** level .
- Slow adjustment to the new optimum level after a shock in the economy for:

    -  **prices**: price setting (Carlton, 1986; Cecchetti, 1985), wage setting or the adjustment of the interest rate            
    -  **quantities**: inputs (labor, capital, intermediate consumption), consumption of households  (Tinbergen,1942).

## Adjustments: Minimizing an adjustment cost function   {.scrollable}

- To take into account that the changes in price are all the more costly that they are large propose to use **quadratic adjustment cost** models (Rotemberg, 1982).     
- The firm defines the optimal price as a trade-off between the **cost of adjusting** and the **cost of not been adjusted**.

\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_t\left(X_t\right)-\Gamma_t\left(X_t^n\right)=\Gamma_t^{\prime}\left(X_t^n\right)\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)+\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)^2
\end{equation}
The profit being maximum for $X_t^n, \Gamma_t^{\prime}\left(X_t^n\right)=0$ and $\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)<0$. As a first approximation, the adjustment cost, i.e. the loss of profit suffered by a company that is not in the optimum, is therefore:
$$
  C_D=\Gamma_t\left(X_t^n\right)-\Gamma_t\left(X_t\right)=C_D\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)^2
$$
Where:
$$
  C_D=-\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)
$$
Suppose that the adjustment cost is proportional to the square of the speed of adjustment:
$$
  C_A=c_A\left(X_t-X_{t-1}\right)^2
$$
Where:
$$
  c_A>0
$$
Minimizing the total cost function $\left(C_t=C_D+C_A\right)$ is equivalent to solving:
$$
  C_t^{\prime}\left(X_t\right)=2 c_D\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)+2 c_A\left(X_t-X_{t-1}\right)=0
$$
The condition of the second order $\left(C_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t\right)>0\right)$ being always verified, the optimal adjustment which minimizes the total cost has the following dynamic process:
$$
  X_t=\alpha X_t^n+(1-\alpha) X_{t-1}
$$
With:
$$
  \alpha=\frac{c_D}{\left(c_D+c_A\right)}
$$

With this simple model, the average adjustment time is:
$$
  \frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha)}=\frac{c_D}{c_A}
$$
**The slower the adjustment, the higher the adjustment cost $c_A$  compared to the cost of non being adjusted $c_D$**.
