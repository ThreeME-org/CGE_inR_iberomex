# Overview of the model

## The ThreeME model   {.scrollable}

-   **M**ulti-sector **M**acroeconomic **M**odel for the **E**valuation of **E**nvironmental and **E**nergy policy

-   Macroeconomic multi-sector model with neo-keynesian features

    -   Avoid the limitations of standard CGE models
        -   Say something about the medium term (not only the long term)
        -   More realistic results for policy makers
    -   Similar dynamic and long term properties than the macroeconomic models used in Economic ministries and forecasting departments
    
-   **Open source** model: www.threeme.org

    -   To avoid usual criticisms on models: black-box, impossible to verify independently the results, too few users
    -   Make application to other countries and by other institutions easier: EU, Mexico & Indonesia (AFD); Tunisia (UNEP), UK (OECD), Luxembourg (Statec), DG Tr√©sor

## Multisector model   {.scrollable}

-   n sectors (e.g. France: n = 37; Tunisia: n = 21, Mexico: n = 24, Luxembourg: n = 26)

-   Allows to analyze the effect of transfer of activities from one sector to another on:

    -   **Employment**, due to different labor intensity
    -   **Investment**, due to different capital intensity
    -   **Energy consumption**, due to different energy intensity
    -   **Trade balance**, due to different propensity to import and export

### Example of sectoral decomposition

-   The economy is disaggregated into **27 sectors**, with in particular:

    -   4 transport sectors
    -   12 energy sectors of which 10 technologies for the production of electricity
        
-   and **23 commodities**

    -   A commodity can be produced by several sectors. E.g. electricity
        
-   The **disaggregation is a compromise** between the availability of the national account and energy data and the objective of the model

-   Several sectors have to be disaggregated

    -   Electricity and gas
    -   Transport

## Example of sectoral decomposition  {.scrollable}
![](pictures/desagregation.jpg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Focus on energy   {.scrollable}

-   The energy disaggregation allows for analyzing the energy behavior of economic agents:

    -   **Sectors** can arbitrate between different energy investments:
        -   Substitution between capital & energy when the relative energy price increases
        -   Substitution between energy sources
        -   Substitution between transports
        -   Endogenous energy efficiency: technical progress increases when the relative energy price increases
        
    -   **Consumers**
        -   Substitution between capital & energy
        -   Substitution between energy sources
        -   Substitution between transports
        -   Substitution between goods

## Type of simulation of the economic and environmental impact   {.scrollable}

-   **Energy transition policies**

    -   Fiscal policies:
        -   Carbon tax with or without redistribution of the tax revenue
        -   Phasing out subsidies on (fossil fuel) energy
        -   Bonus-malus for cars: subsidies on green cars financed by a tax on other cars
    -   Change in the electricity production mix
        -   Ex: more RES in the mix
    -   Impact of green investment
        -   In buildings, public transport, etc.
        -   Impact of applying a new standard for buildings, or appliances
        
-   **External shock**

    -   Increase in international oil/gas price

## CGE model   {.scrollable}

-   **Computable:** numerical simulation
-   **General:** take into account the interactions between markets.

    -   Supply and demand influence each other
    
-   **Equilibrium:** Supply is equal to demand on all markets (good, production factors)

-   Structure of a CGE model (see next Figure):

    -   Demand (Consumption, investment) defines the supply (production)
    -   Supply defines in return the demand through the incomes generated by the production factors

## CGE model

![](pictures/schema.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## What does ***general equilibrium*** mean?   {.scrollable}

-   General Equilibrium relates to a state where supply is equal to demand in all markets
-   2 main approaches to insure this state:

    -   **Walrasian** models
        -   The equilibrium force is the price system
        -   Perfect price flexibility insure the instantaneous equilibrium between supply and demand
        -   When the supply of a commodity goes down, its price tends to go up, thereby stimulating additional supply and depressing demand, until supply and demand are equal again.
        
        -   Static model
    -   **Neo-Keynesian** models
        -   Demand determines supply in the short run
        -   Price and quantities are rigid and adjust slowly
        -   Disequilibrium between notional (optimal) supply and the actual supply in the short run
        -   Dynamic model: transition to the long run

## A neo-keynesian CGE model   {.scrollable}

-   **Slow adjustment** of price and quantity

    -   Adjustment costs
    -   Empirically firms adjust their production to the demand rather than their price

-   Leads to situation of **disequilibrium** between the desired supply and demand

-   **Prices** are defined as a mark-up over the firm's production costs

    -   Production costs integrate intermediary consumption (material and energy), labor and capital costs

-   Wages are determined by a **Wage Setting (WS) curve**

    -   Phillips curve: wages increase with inflation and decrease with unemployment
    -   Wages do not adjust instantaneously the supply and demand for labor:
        -   Permanent underemployment equilibrium possible
        -   Theory of the NAIRU (Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) or Equilibrium rate of unemployment
        
-   The **interest rate** does not equilibrate instantaneously saving and investment:

    -   It is defined by the Central Bank
    -   "Taylor" reaction function: increases with inflation, decreases with unemployment

## Key properties of ThreeME   {.scrollable}

-   **General equilibrium effects**

    -   Supply influence demand and vice versa
    
-   **Direct and indirect effects** of the energy transition

    -   Direct effects: impact for the energy sectors
    -   Indirect effects: impact for the rest of the economy (in particular the other sectors, the government, households).
    
-   **Limited eviction effects**

    -   Investment is not only defined by saving
    -   The financing through bank credit does not necessary lead to an increase of the interest rate
    -   The augmentation of investment in one sector is not necessary achieved through a decrease of investment in other sectors

## The value-added compared to existing models   {.scrollable}

-   Sectorial disaggregation

    -   Make explicit the negative and positive impacts for each sector according to its own specificities.\
-   High technological disaggregation of the energy system

    -   Ex: electricity produced by several technology
    -   Each technology having their own cost and production function
    -   Link between economic activity, energy production in physical terms (Mtoe or Mwh) and CO2 emissions more accurate.
    
-   General Equilibrium

    -   Allows for taking into account of indirect and feedback effects (rebound effects)
    
-   Neo-keynesian features

    -   Allows for studying transition and disequilibrium phases (such underemployment)

## The value-added compared to existing models   {.scrollable}

-   Hybrid modelling

    -   Link bottom-up and top-down approaches
    -   Detailed energy technologies and coherent macroeconomic framework
    
-   Possibility of combination with an energy system model

    -   The bottom-up development of the energy sectors makes it possible to combine ThreeME with an energy system model without loss of relevant information
    -   Assessment of scenarios compatible with the technical constraints regarding the feasible energy mix.

## Data: Supply-Use (SU) and Input-Output (IO) tables   {.scrollable}

-   SU table says how much a given commodities is supplied by a given sector (Supply)

    -   Generally close to a diagonal matrix
    
-   IO table says how much a given commodities is purchased by a given sector (Demand)

    -   Not a diagonal matrix

![](pictures/Simplified_SU_IO.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Equilibrium between Supply and Demand (use)   {.scrollable}

-   GDP = VA = Y -- CI = C + I + X - M

# Main equations

## Adjustment mechanisms   {.scrollable}

-   ThreeME takes into account explicitly the **slow adjustment of prices and quantities** (factors of production, consumption)

-   ThreeME assumes that the **actual** levels of prices and quantities gradually adjust to their **notional** level 

-   The **notional** level corresponds to the **optimal (desired or target)** level that the economic agent would choose in the absence of adjustment constraints

-   **Microeconomic foundation** for a slow adjustment process:  

    -   Adjustment models: Eisner and Strotz (1963) and Gould (1968), Lucas (1967), Schramm (1970) and Treadway (1971), Rotemberg (1982) 
    
    -  The adjustment process is derived from an optimal behavior: **minimizing an adjustment cost function** (Rotemberg,1982) 
 
## Adjustment mechanisms   {.scrollable}
    
- **Adjustment process** and **expectations** for prices and quantities represented by the following equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-efective_adjustement}
\small
\operatorname{log} X_{t} = \alpha^{{0},X} \; \operatorname{log} X^{n}_{t} + \left( 1 - \alpha^{{0},X} \right) \; \left( \operatorname{log} X_{t-1} + \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X^{e}_{t}\right) \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{split}
\label{eq-expected_adjustement}
\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X^{e}_{t}\right) = \alpha^{{1},X} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X^{e}_{t-1}\right) + \alpha^{{2},X}\; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X_{t-1}\right) \\ 
+ \alpha^{{3},X} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X^{n}_t\right) + \alpha^{{4},X} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X_{t+1}\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $X_{t}$ is the effective value of a given variable, $X^{n}_t$ is its notional level, $X^{e}_t$ its expected (anticipated) value at period $t$ and $\alpha^{{i},X}$ are the adjustments parameters, with $\alpha^{{1},X} + \alpha^{{2},X} + \alpha^{{3},X}  + \alpha^{{4},X} = 1$.

## Adjustments: Minimizing an adjustment cost function   {.scrollable}

- To take into account that the changes in price are all the more costly that they are large propose to use **quadratic adjustment cost** models (Rotemberg, 1982).     
- The firm defines the optimal price as a trade-off between the **cost of adjusting** and the **cost of not been adjusted**.

\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_t\left(X_t\right)-\Gamma_t\left(X_t^n\right)=\Gamma_t^{\prime}\left(X_t^n\right)\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)+\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)^2
\end{equation}
The profit being maximum for $X_t^n, \Gamma_t^{\prime}\left(X_t^n\right)=0$ and $\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)<0$. As a first approximation, the adjustment cost, i.e. the loss of profit suffered by a company that is not in the optimum, is therefore:
$$
  C_D=\Gamma_t\left(X_t^n\right)-\Gamma_t\left(X_t\right)=C_D\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)^2
$$
Where:
$$
  C_D=-\Gamma_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t^n\right)
$$
Suppose that the adjustment cost is proportional to the square of the speed of adjustment:
$$
  C_A=c_A\left(X_t-X_{t-1}\right)^2
$$
Where:
$$
  c_A>0
$$
Minimizing the total cost function $\left(C_t=C_D+C_A\right)$ is equivalent to solving:
$$
  C_t^{\prime}\left(X_t\right)=2 c_D\left(X_t-X_t^n\right)+2 c_A\left(X_t-X_{t-1}\right)=0
$$
The condition of the second order $\left(C_t^{\prime \prime}\left(X_t\right)>0\right)$ being always verified, the optimal adjustment which minimizes the total cost has the following dynamic process:
$$
  X_t=\alpha X_t^n+(1-\alpha) X_{t-1}
$$
With:
$$
  \alpha=\frac{c_D}{\left(c_D+c_A\right)}
$$

With this simple model, the average adjustment time is:
$$
  \frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha)}=\frac{c_D}{c_A}
$$
**The slower the adjustment, the higher the adjustment cost $c_A$  compared to the cost of non being adjusted $c_D$**.



## Production of commodities of each sector {.scrollable}


- The production of a commodity can be produced by several sectors:

$$Y_{c, s} = \varphi^{Y}_{c, s} \; YQ_{c}$$

- $YQ_c$ : aggregated domestic production of commodity $c$. It is determined by the demand (intermediate and final consumption, investment, public spending, exports and stock variation).
- $PhiY_{c, s}$ : share of commodity $c$ produced by the sector $s$ (with $\sum_{s} phiY_{c,s} =1$) 

- Aggregated production of sector $s$:

$$Y_{s} = \sum_{s} Y_{c, s}$$


## Structure of production {.scrollable}

![](pictures/production_structure.jpg)


## Demand for production factors    {.scrollable}

- Notional production factors demand derived from a production **costs minimization** program assuming a **Variable Output Elasticity (VOE) Cobb‚ÄìDouglas production function** 

    -   more flexible production function than the CES function:  elasticity of substitution can differ between pair of inputs
    - Reyn√®s, F. (2019). The Cobb‚ÄìDouglas function as a flexible function: A new perspective on homogeneous functions through the lens of output elasticities. Mathematical Social Sciences, 97, 11-17.

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} F^{n}_{f, s}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} Y_{s}\right) - \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} PROG_{f, s}\right) + \varDelta \left(SUBST^{F}_{f, s}\right)$$

$$\varDelta \left(SUBST^{F,n}_{f, s}\right) = \sum_{ff} -ES_{f, ff, s} \; \varphi_{ff, s, t-1} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \frac{C_{f, s}}{PROG_{f, s}} - \operatorname{log} \frac{C_{ff, s}}{PROG_{ff, s}}\right)$$

- Input (cost) share: $$\varphi_{f, s} = \frac{C_{f, s} \; F^{n}_{f, s}}{\sum_{ff} C_{ff, s} \; F^{n}_{ff, s}}$$
- Notional demand of input $f$ ($KLEM$): $F_{f,s}^n$
- Elasticity of substitution (ES) between the pairs of inputs $f$ and $ff$: $ES_{f,ff,s}$
- Technical progress related to input $f$: $PROG_{f,s}$
- Cost/price of input $f$: $C_{f,s}$
- Production of sector $s$: $Y_{s}$

##  Nested CES production function {.schrollable}


![](pictures/nested_CES.jpg)

##  Nested CES production function {.schrollable}

- At the first level, material (M) can be substituted with the aggregate capital/energy/labor (KEL) with an ES of $\sigma^{NEST^{MAT,KEL}}$ . 
- At the second level, the aggregate capital/energy (KE) is a substitute to labor (L) with an ES of $\sigma^{NEST^{KE,L}}$. 
- At the third level, capital (K) can be substituted to energy (E) with an ES of $\sigma^{NEST^{K,E}}$. 

$$ES_{K, E, s} = \frac{\eta^{NEST^{K,E}}_{s}}{\left( 1 - \varphi_{MAT, s} - \varphi_{L, s} \right) - \frac{\eta^{NEST^{MAT,KEL}}_{s}}{\left( 1 - \varphi_{MAT, s} \right) - \eta^{NEST^{KE,L}}_{s} \; \frac{\varphi_{L, s}}{\frac{1 - \varphi_{MAT, s}}{1 - \varphi_{MAT, s} - \varphi_{L, s}}}}}$$

$$ES_{K, L, s} = \frac{\eta^{NEST^{KE,L}}_{s} - \eta^{NEST^{MAT,KEL}}_{s} \; \varphi_{MAT, s}}{1 - \varphi_{MAT, s}}$$


## Investment and capital {.scrollable}

-   Investment depends:

    -   on the anticipated production, on its past dynamic
    -   on substitution phenomena
    -   on a correction mechanism, which guaranties that the level of notional capital stock is reached in the long-term 

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} IA_{s}\right) = \alpha^{IA,Ye}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} Y^{e}_{s}\right) + \alpha^{IA,IA1}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} IA_{s, t-1}\right) \\
+ \alpha^{IA,SUBST}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(SUBST^{F}_{K, s}\right) \\
+ \alpha^{IA,Kn}_{s} \; \left( \operatorname{log} F^{n}_{K, s, t-1} - \operatorname{log} F_{K, s, t-1} \right)$$

-   Stock of capital deducted from investment according to the standard capital accumulation equation:


$$F_{K, s} = \left( 1 - \delta_{s} \right) \; F_{K, s, t-1} + IA_{s}$$


## Price setting {.scrollable}

-   The **notional production price** for each sector is set by applying a mark-up over the unit cost of production

    -   Costs include labor, capital, energy and other intermediate consumption costs

$$PY^{n}_{s} = CU^{n}_{s} \; \left( 1 + \mu_{s} \right)$$

Where $PY^n$ is the notional price, $CU^n_s$ the unitary cost of production and $\mu_{s}$ is the mark-up.


-   **Notional mark-up** of each sector depends on the capacity utilization ratio:

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(1 + \mu^{n}_{s}\right)\right) = \rho^{\mu,Y} . \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} CUR_{s}\right)$$
-   **capacity utilization ratio**
$$CUR_{s} = \frac{Y_{s}}{YCAP_{s}}$$
-   **Production capacity**

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} YCAP_{s}\right) = \sum_{f} \varphi_{f, s, t-1} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(F_{f, s} \; PROG_{f, s}\right)\right) $$

-->

## Wage setting {.scrollable}

- The notional nominal wage ($W^n_s$) positively depends on the anticipated consumption price ($P^e$) and on the labor productivity ($PROG^L_s$), and negatively on the unemployment rate ($UnR$): 

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} W^{n}_{s}\right) = \rho^{W,Cons}_{s} + \rho^{W,P}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} P\right) + \rho^{W,Pe}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} P^{e}\right) \\
+ \rho^{W,PROG}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} PROG^{L}_{s}\right) - \rho^{W,U}_{s} \; \left( UnR - DNAIRU \right) \\
- \rho^{W,DU}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(UnR\right) + \rho^{W,L}_{s} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} F_{L, s} - \operatorname{log} F_{L}\right)$$


- General specification that includes the Phillips and Wage Setting (WS) curves depending on the value of the selected parameters (Heyer et al., 2007; Reyn√®s, 2010)

    - Phillips curve if $\rho^{W,U}_{s}\neq 0$
    - WS curve if $\rho^{W,U}_{s} = 0$
      - Constraints of the specification proposed by Layard *et al.*
        - Unitary indexation of wages on inflation ( $\rho^{W,P}_{s}+\rho^{W,Pe}_{s}=1$), and on labor productivity ($\rho^{W,PROG}_{s}=1$)
        - $\rho^{W,Cons}_{s}=0$ 



## Interest rate {.scrollable}

-   In the neo-Keynesian framework, it is standard to assume that the interest rate is set by the Central Bank (CB) according to a Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993).
-   The CB maximizes an objective function by making a trade-off between inflation and economic activity (unemployment)
-   The real interest rate is 

    -   a **positive** function of **inflation**
    -   a **negative** function of the **unemployment rate** (proxi of the output gap)

$$\varDelta \left(R^{n}\right) = \rho^{Rn,P} . \varDelta \left(\frac{\varDelta \left(P\right)}{P_{t-1}}\right) - \rho^{Rn,UnR} . \varDelta \left(UnR\right)$$

## Aggregate households‚Äô consumption {.scrollable}

- The notional (optimal) aggregate households consumption corresponds to a share of their current income:

$$CH^{n,VAL} = DISPINC^{AT,VAL} . \left( 1 - MPS^{n} \right)$$

Where $CH^{n,VAL}$ is the  aggregate notional households final consumption expressed in value, $DISPINC^{AT,VAL}$ is the households‚Äô disposable income 
- The notional marginal propensity to save ($MPS^n$ their ) depends on the real interest rate and on the unemployment rate:

$$\varDelta \left(MPS^{n}\right) = \rho^{MPS,R} . \varDelta \left(R - \frac{\varDelta \left(P\right)}{P_{t-1}}\right) + \rho^{MPS,UnR} . \varDelta \left(UnR\right)$$


## Households‚Äô consumption per commodity {.scrollable}


ThreeME includes three model variants for the allocation of the aggregate consumption between the different commodities:

- Variant 1: LES utility function
- Variant 2: Nested utility function
- Variant 3: Hybrid approach

## Variant 1: LES utility function  {.scrollable}

- In the standard version of the model, consumption decisions between commodities are modeled through a **Linear Expenditure System** (LES) utility function generalized to the case of a non-unitary elasticity of substitution between the commodities (Brown and Heien, 1972). 
- A LES specification assumes that a share of the base year consumption ($NCH_c$) is incompressible: the relation between income and consumption is not linear
- This specification allows for the distinction between the consumption of necessity and luxurious goods

- Notional consumption of commodity $c$:
$$\left( CH^{n}_{c} - NCH_{c} \right) \; PCH_{c} = \varphi^{MCH}_{c} \; \left( CH^{n,VAL} - PNCH . NCH \right)$$

- Share of consumption of commodity $c$:

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \varphi^{MCH}_{c}\right) = \left( 1 - \eta^{LESCES} \right) . \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \frac{PCH_{c}}{PCH^{CES}}\right)$$

- CES consumer price index:

$$PCH^{CES} = \left( \sum_{c} \varphi^{MCH}_{c, t_0} \; PCH_{c} ^ {\left( 1 - \eta^{LESCES} \right)} \right) ^ {\left( \frac{1}{\left( 1 - \eta^{LESCES} \right)} \right)}$$


## Variant 2: Nested utility function  {.scrollable}

![](pictures/nested_structure_hh.jpg)


## Variant 3: Hybrid approach  {.scrollable}

- Calibrated for the French version of ThreeME
- Bottom-up modeling of the stock of buildings and automobiles per energy label and type of fuel

## Foreign trade  {.scrollable}

- **Exports** are determined by the external demand addressed to domestic products and the ratio between the export and world prices:

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} X_{c}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} WD_{c}\right) + \varDelta \left(SUBST^{X}_{c}\right)$$

$$\varDelta \left(SUBST^{X,n}_{c}\right) = -\eta^{X}_{c} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} PX_{c} - \operatorname{log} \left(EXR . PWD_{c}\right)\right)$$

Where $WD_{c}$ is the world demand, $PWD_{c}$ its price. $PX_{c}$ is the export price that depends on the production costs and which reflects the price-competitiveness of the domestic products. $EXR$ is the exchange rate; $\sigma^{X}_{c}$ is the price-elasticity (assumed constant).

- **Imports** are modeled per use (intermediate consumption per commodity and sector, households consumption, investment, public expenditure)
- We assume imperfect substitution between domestic and imported goods (Armington, 1969)
- Demand for domestic and imported products of use $A$:

$$AM_{c} = \varphi^{AM}_{c} \; A_{c}$$

$$AD_{c} = \left( 1 - \varphi^{AM}_{c} \right) \; A_{c}$$

- Import share for use $A$:

$$\varphi^{AM}_{c} = \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{AD_{c}}{AM_{c}, t_0} \; \operatorname{exp} SUBST^{AM}_{c} \right)}$$
$$\varDelta \left(SUBST^{AM,n}_{c}\right) = -\sigma^{AM}_{c} \; \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} PAD_{c} - \operatorname{log} PAM_{c}\right)$$

$$SUBST^{AM}_{c} = \alpha^{{6},AM}_{c} \; SUBST^{AM,n}_{c} + \left( 1 - \alpha^{{6},AM}_{c} \right) \; SUBST^{AM}_{c, t-1}$$


## Government  {.scrollable}

- According to the national accounts, public administrations generally refer to the central and regional government services and social security administration. 
- In ThreeME, three components are aggregated in order to focus on transfers between public administrations, household and sectors.

### Government's resources ($INC^{G,VAL}$) :

$$INC^{G,VAL} = PNTAXC . NTAXC + NTAXS^{VAL} + INC^{SOC,TAX,VAL} \\
+ PRSC . RSC + PROP^{INC,G,VAL}$$

with:

- The aggregate net taxes on commodity $c$ expressed in value: $PNTAXC.NTAXC$
- The aggregate net taxes on production of sectors expressed in value: $NTAXS^VAL$
- The income and social taxes expressed in value: $INS^{SOC,TAX,VAL}$
- The aggregate employers' social security contribution paid by sector: $PRSC.RSC$
- The property income of the Government expressed in value: $PROP^{INC,G,VAL}$


### Government's expenditures ($SPEND^{G,VAL}$):

$$SPEND^{G,VAL} = PG . G + SOC^{BENF,VAL} + DEBT^{G,VAL}_{t-1} \; \left( \varphi^{RD^{G}}_{t-1} + r^{DEBT,G}_{t-1} \right)$$

with: 

- The government final consumption: $PG.G$
- The Social benefits expressed in value: $SOC^{BENF,VAL}$
- The interest paid by the government on its debt plus the share of debt reimbursed every year: $DEBT^{G,VAL}_{t-1}\left(\varphi^{RD^G}_{t-1} + r^{DEBT,G}_{t-1}\right)$

## Greenhouse gases emissions  {.scrollable}

- Energy consumption detailed by economic agents (households and economic sectors) for each energy source (coal, oil, gas, electricity).
- This allows for simulating GHG emissions per agents and per energy source 
- The calculation of emissions level consists in multiplying the fossil energy demand by the corresponding emission coefficients. These coefficients are specific for each economic actor, each sector and each energy sources depending on their carbon intensity. 

**Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the intermediary consumption of commodity $c$ by sector $s$**

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} EMS^{CI}_{ghg, c, s}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(CI_{c, s} \; IEMS^{CI}_{ghg, c, s}\right)\right)$$

where $IEMS^{CI}_{ghg, c, s}$ is the corresponding emission intensity calibrated to 1 in the base year. It may change over time because of the increase of the share of biofuels.

**Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the household consumption $c$**

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} EMS^{CH}_{ghg, c}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(CH_{c} \; IEMS^{CH}_{ghg, c}\right)\right)$$


**Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$  related to the final production of sector $s$**

$$\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} EMS^{Y}_{ghg, s}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(Y_{s} \; IEMS^{Y}_{ghg, s}\right)\right)$$

**Emissions of the greenhouse gas $ghg$ related to the  materials consumption of sector $s$**

\begin{equation}
\small
\varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} EMS^{MAT}_{ghg, s}\right) = \varDelta \left(\operatorname{log} \left(F_{MAT, s} \; IEMS^{MAT}_{ghg, s}\right)\right)
\end{equation}

$CO_2$ emissions from decarbonation during the production process for the non mineral metallic products, as the glass or ceramic sectors, is assumed proportional to the quantity of intermediate raw material used in the production process.

## Energy balance  {.scrollable}

###  Energy balance versus economic equilibrium

The energy module of ThreeME is based on a reformulation of the energy balance into meaningful economic concepts. The energy balance published by Eurostat uses the following definition for energy supply:

- Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) = Primary production + Imports - Exports + Change in stock (energy balance definition)


*Energy intermediate consumptions* as defined in the national accounts correspond to three different concepts in the energy balance:

- Energy transformation input
- *Energy sector own use* **excluding** the auto-consumptions
- *Final consumption* of non-energy sectors (*final* in the sense of the energy balance).


In order to facilitate the link between the energy balance in physical units to the national accounts equilibrium defined in ThreeME, we have to rewrite the energy balance consistently. For this, we first need to make a distinction between the *gross supply* and the *net supply* of an energy commodity. The *gross supply* includes the domestic and imported primary and secondary production (as defined in the energy balance):

- Gross supply = Primary production + Energy transformation output (secondary production) + Imports


The *gross supply* is not relevant economically for the end user because it includes distribution losses and auto-consumption. What is relevant for the end user is what she actually purchases, i.e. the domestic and imported supply net from distribution losses and auto-consumption:   

- Net supply = Domestic net production + Imported net production = Gross supply - Distribution losses - Auto-consumption

With this definition, we can rewrite the energy balance in an economically consistent way where the net supply of an energy commodity should be equal to its end use:

- Net supply = Energy transformation input + Energy sector own use (excluding auto-consumption) + Final consumption + Exports +  Change in stock (national account definition)
